                </div>
                <p>My tryst with 3D printing began when I interned at a small 3D printing startup during my 3rd year of university. Commercial 3D printing was becoming easier to access and it was plain to see that the market was set to explode in 2017. <a href="https://precious3d.com/" class="new-tab">Precious 3D</a> was where I first cut my teeth in <span class="highlight">product design</span>. My work involved meeting with clients, understanding their product needs, and then designing a components that were optimised for 3D printing. Some notable projects included the design of Chetak Helicopter models for the Indian Air Force, trophies for Hyundai and Larsen & Toubro, cases for Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards, pen holders for Prozeal, and cases for wall inserted IOT devices. </p>
                <p>These experiences encouraged me to buy a 3D printer of my own, seek out freelancing jobs, and help my classmates print complex parts for their final year projects. This same 3D printer was used during my time at <a href="/pages/projects/project-makara.html" class="new-tab">Makara Cycles</a> for all their R&D and prototyping needs. My passion for rapid prototyping led me to pursue a master's degree with a <span class="highlight">specialisation in Additive Manufacturing</span> where I was exposed to the latest technology in this domain. In fact, the <a href="https://research.ec-nantes.fr/en/research-facilities/rapid-manufacturing-platform-1" class="new-tab">Additive Manufacturing and Biofabrication Platform</a> at Centrale Nantes works with some of the biggest stakeholders in the industry to create products that are physically impossible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques.</p>
                <p>My 3D printing experience continued at <a href="/pages/projects/project-vitibot.html" class="new-tab">VitiBot</a> where I was in charge of all 3D printing activities for the duration of my internship. In addition to prototyping mechanical components, I worked closely with the electrical team and production for their printing needs as well.</p>
