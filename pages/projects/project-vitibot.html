                <h2>VitiBot</h2>
                <i><a href="https://vitibot.fr" class="new-tab">VitiBot</a> is a leading manufacturer of fully electric, autonomous vineyard robots based in the Champagne region of France.</i>
            </div>
            <p>I joined VitiBot as an intern while completing my master's thesis, and was quickly offered a full-time job in the mechanical team 3 months in to my internship. Drawing on prior experience at Makara Cycles, CNRS, and Centrale Nantes, I contributed to several core components of the BAKUS robot platform. My first major assignment was the design of an <span class="highlight">intervine mower</span> tailored to the BAKUS robot, where I was able to deliver a working prototype that achieved <span class="highlight">commercial success</span> within a year. This success led to further iterations in collaboration with key industry stakeholders.</p>
            <p>In addition to the mower, I led and contributed to several critical engineering efforts including the redesign of the <span class="highlight">4-bar tool holder mechanism</span> to use fully electric linear actuators in place of electro-hydraulic actuators, the redesign of battery casings in thermoplastic to double their lifespan, the <span class="highlight">integration of high power electric motors</span> into existing robot hardware, and the redesign of various other stationary and active tools for the robot. With each of these endeavours, I honed my skills in FEA to validate not only my designs, but also the designs of my colleagues, and concurrently learned to use Python and <span class="highlight">ANSYS ACT</span> to automate my tasks and visualise results.</p>
            <p>My most impactful contribution was leading the <span class="highlight">complete redesign</span> of the BAKUS robot chassis. This multi-year project was critical in preventing fatigue-related failures that could have triggered a full fleet recall. Under my technical leadership, we delivered a lighter, stronger chassis that preserved existing internal and external interfaces and could be seamlessly integrated with deployed units and manufacturing lines.</p>
