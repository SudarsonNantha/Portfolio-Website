                    <h2>Automotive Projects</h2>
                </div>

                <p>During my time at university, I took part in several automotive and motorsports competitions. This was my first experience putting what I learned in class to practice, and the process of designing vehicles played an enormous part in helping me decide the course of my professional career.</p>

                    <div class="info-line"><strong>Roles:</strong><span>Team Captain, Vice Captain, Lead Designer, Chassis Designer</span></div>
                    <div class="info-line"><strong>Tools:</strong><span>CATIA V5, CATIA Ergonomics Design & Analysis, Solidworks, Solidworks Simulation</span></div>

                <h3> Eco Kart 2016 </h3>
                <p>Eco Kart is an initiative of Viridescent Educational Services where students compete to design and fabricate a single passenger kart which is operated by an electric motor. This was the <span class="highlight">first project of this type</span> that anyone in our university had ever done, so there were very few places our team could go for guidance. Admittedly, the go-kart ended up being made with several critical design flaws and an electrical system that could not handle the power requirements of the 3kW BLDC motor we put into it. Upon burning our motor controller at the 11th hour, our team returned home defeated, but determined to be victorious the next year.<span class="highlight"></span> </p>

                <h3> ISK 2017 </h3>
                <p>International Series of Karting (ISK) is an event initiated by Mean Metal Motors for undergraduates from around the world to build and race their own go-kart with international standards and rules. Following our failure at Ecokart 2016, my colleagues and I studied vigorously and honed our designing skills to create a race worthy go-kart. We decided to dial it down and try our hand at building an internal combustion engine go-kart first. As the <span class="highlight">Team Captain and Lead Designer</span>, this was a great opportunity to master vehicular dynamics, chassis design, and my leadership skills. Though we did not receive an accolades for this go-kart, our team built a solid foundation for our engineering skills.<span class="highlight"></span></p>

                <h3> Eco Kart 2017 </h3>
                <p>With the taste of defeat fresh in our minds, and having developed our skills over the course of the year, our team launched into the Eco Kart 2017 project prepared to make a come back. Once again playing the role of <span class="highlight">Team Captain and Lead Designer</span>, I took meticulous care during the design, simulation, and validation phases to not repeat the mistakes of yesteryear. With the help of industry experts in electrical systems design and fabrication, we unleashed the cumulation of our years of hard work on track. It all paid off in the end when our team won the <span class="highlight">"Fastest Accelerating Kart” award</span> for our go-kart's excellence in the acceleration and skidpad event.<span class="highlight"></span> </p>

                <h3> ESVC 2017 </h3>
                <p>Electric Solar Vehicle Championship (ESVC) conducted by Imperial Society of Innovative Engineers (ISIE) is Asia’s 1st solar vehicle design and manufacturing event for engineering and diploma students. Having gotten a taste of building electric vehicles, our team embarked on this project to further hone our skills in eco-friendly transportation. This project saw me as Vice Captain and Lead Designer, once again taking charge of designing the <span class="highlight">chassis, transmission, brakes, and suspension</span> systems.<span class="highlight"></span> </p>

                <h3> IKR 2018 </h3>
                <p>IKR is a go-kart design and manufacturing competition also conducted by ISIE. Other team members took charge of leading the team while I remained the <span class="highlight">Lead Designer</span>, once again designing the chassis, transmission, and brake components. This project saw us move away from CATIA V5 and employ Solidworks as our primary design software.</p>

                <h3> FSAE 2021 </h3>
                <p>Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by SAE International to design, fabricate, and race an open-wheeled vehicle. Standing on top of my year of experience designing go-kart and bicycle chassis at this point, I naturally felt at home in my role as <span class="highlight">Chassis Designer</span>. My role also saw me calculate suspension parameters and design double wishbone geometry for the vehicle. I took part in this project during the course of my masters, but unfortunately our team did not make it make the design phase due to time and budget constraints. <span class="highlight"></span> </p>
